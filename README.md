Overview of the Project

Objective:
This project focuses on automating the summarization of textual content using both extractive and abstractive techniques. The goal is to analyze and condense large text documents into concise summaries, making the information easier to digest and more accessible. The project leverages Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK and Hugging Face's transformers to perform text summarization effectively.

Dataset Description:
The dataset for this project consists of various text samples that need summarization. The dataset is not explicitly structured but contains text from different domains, including scientific articles, blog posts, and news reports. The main objective is to test the summarization methods' ability to condense the text meaningfully.

Methodology Deployed:

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and prepare text data by removing punctuation and tokenizing it into sentences to make it suitable for summarization.

Extractive Summarization:

Sentences are vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Cosine similarity is calculated between sentences, and the top sentences that best represent the document are selected to create a summary.
This method provides a direct extraction of key sentences from the text.
Abstractive Summarization:

Use the Hugging Face pipeline with the BART model to generate an abstractive summary.
This method reformulates and condenses the original content into a new, concise version while maintaining key ideas.
Summarization Function:

The summarize() function allows users to choose between extractive or abstractive methods for summarization.
The extractive_summary function ranks sentences based on similarity, while the abstractive_summary generates a new text summary using a pre-trained model.
Expected Outcomes:

Efficient and meaningful summaries of text, whether by extracting key sentences or generating an entirely new, condensed version of the text.
Insights into the effectiveness of both summarization techniques for different types of content.
Demonstration of how NLP techniques can improve content consumption and decision-making in various applications such as business intelligence, content creation, and research.
Key Insights and Recommendations:

Use extractive summarization for when key sentences need to be retained directly from the original text.
Use abstractive summarization for generating more coherent, human-like summaries suitable for high-level content consumption.
